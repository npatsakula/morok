//! Process-global cache of immutable weight storages, keyed by checkpoint
//! provenance. Loading the same file into N model instances uploads each
//! weight ONCE and shares the device storage; the storage is sealed
//! immutable so no handle can corrupt a peer model. `Weak` values: the last
//! model's teardown frees the VRAM, and dead entries are pruned on the next
//! lookup. Concurrent loads of one file dedup through singleflight — one
//! thread allocates and uploads, the rest reuse.
//!
//! Sharing is gated strictly on PROVENANCE + immutability, never on
//! structural graph equality — value-identical mutable tensors (JIT inputs)
//! must never share storage.
